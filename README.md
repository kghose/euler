Project Euler problems

Just me working through the project Euler problems, learning Racket on the way.



Concepts and the files in which they are implemented

## Structures


## Fixtures for tests
Not completely fixtures, but you can put `defines` inside a `test-case` so that you
can set up data structures and then operate on them. e.g: p13.rkt


## Sum of row/column of a matrix
`array-axis-sum` e.g. p13.rkt


## Accessing multiple values returned from a function
See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20556746/how-do-i-do-anything-with-multiple-return-values-in-racket/20556950#20556950

Use `let-values`. See p13.rkt
